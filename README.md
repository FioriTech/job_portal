# StarWars
A simple login and search application implementing Swapi API built using Redux Framework.

I have used Gulp as a automation task runner and WebPack as a module bundler.

Project is written in JS ES6 specification.

The server call to the local server for data is done using Reqwest from Client End.

The API call to the Swapi API is done using Node fetch inside server folder.
